### MCEN Group Automation
[P1 GitLab Repository \(Requires Authentication\)](https://code.il2.dso.mil/marine-coders/mcen-group-automation)

 * **Purpose**: To automate MCEN Groups by adding and removing users based on unit rosters.

 * **Problem**: Information Security Clerks (ISC) are usually tasked out to update distribution lists. These distribution lists usually include hundreds to thousands of individuals. Cleaning Active Directory groups provide a clean and healthy COMSEC environment.

 * **Execution**: Using [Active Directory library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/?view=windowsserver2019-ps) in PowerShell automate the process of "scanning" through users, determine which users need to be added to which groups and remove users who are no longer required to be on the distribution list.
