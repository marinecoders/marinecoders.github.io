# II MIG Marine Coders Cell Established!

#### The II MIG CO, Colonel Russel, signed the II MIG Marine Coder charter today effectively establishing the first Marine Coder Cell in the Fleet Marine Force.  

Cells are a critical component to scaling the Marine Coder movement and connecting Marines in the fleet to tools, environments, training and resources championed by Marine Coders!   

We look forward to working with the II MIG Marine Coder Cell to progress the maturity of software development capability for Marines.  Thank you all the Marines and civilians at II MIG for all the work to make this a reality!

Last, we expect I MIG and III MIG to be fast followers!
