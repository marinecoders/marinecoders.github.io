Marine Coders hosted its first hackathon to produce a Naval Letter Format Generator Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  A team of (5) active duty Marines developed the application in a day's work using Github, video teleconferencing, and Platform One's Mattermost Chat service to enable remote collaboration.
The application allows a user to enter all the standard Naval Letter fields, then generate a word document on their local computer.  All data is stored on the client's device, and there is no data stored on any external servers.  Future releases of the application will include more complex Naval Letter use cases and the team will explore feasibility of inculding PDF exports and digital signtures.  Special thanks to NavalX for hosting our first hackathon!
