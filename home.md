We are a group of U.S. Air Force Airmen who use code to improve the lives of our fellow Airmen.

## Team Guidelines
* We build code to help Airmen, they are our customers not our OPRs/EPRs!
* We open source as much as possible [cio.gov](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/) [code.mil](https://code.mil)
* We are responsible users of existing open source code
* We help each other


## Have questions or want to join us?
Send an email to AirmenCoders [at] us.af.mil, we would love to hear from you!
